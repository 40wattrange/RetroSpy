Tutorial for N64 wire splice
======

Are you mad because I'm 5'11", 210 pounds, 12%-13% bodyfat, and able to bench almost 315 pounds and you aren't? I'm on a bulk right now, but I should be cutting next week, just in time for the summer. So while I'm rocking some killer abs at 10% bodyfat on the beach, you're going to be on here making fun of the few people who exist in this entire world that are actually more pathetic than you.
I bet you're like 20% bodyfat and don't even count your daily caloric intake. Don't worry, though; no one can tell how fat and disgusting you are if you never leave your basement, and thus never see any people in real life.
Say what you want about me, but just know that I'm extremely athletic and good looking (at least the 9s and 10s who approach me seem to think so), and you're... not? Is that a fair assumption to make? Yeah, let's just go with that. Never been wrong before about the quality of "people" on Reddit before.

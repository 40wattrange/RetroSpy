RetroSpy Setup for Original Xbox
======

## Why Experimental?

Xbox is experimental because it currently requires a 400 dollar USB protocol analyzer.  So this solution is only for the most dedicated.

## Components and Equipment needed

1. [Beagle USB 12 Protocol Analyzer](https://www.totalphase.com/products/beagle-usb12/)
3. [USB Adapter Cable for Xbox](https://www.amazon.com/NEORTX-Adapter-Cable-Xbox-Black/dp/B00SMCJB4Y/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1549049686&sr=8-6&keywords=xbox+usb)
3. [Xbox Controller to PC USB Adapter Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Mcbazel-Replacement-Xbox-Controller-Adapter-Microsoft/dp/B000RT2868/ref=sr_1_18?ie=UTF8&qid=1549049720&sr=8-18&keywords=xbox+controller+to+pc)
4. [USB Splitter Cable Male to 2 Female Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KX4TKH6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Software

1. [Windows USB Drivers for Beagle 12](https://www.totalphase.com/products/usb-drivers-windows/)
2. 64-bit Windows PC to run the display software. Xbox is not currently supported on 32-bit machines or 32-bit Windows.

Just run ``RetroSpy.exe`` to launch the display software.

## Setup

1. Install the [Windows USB Drivers for Beagle 12](https://www.totalphase.com/products/usb-drivers-windows/).

2. Plug the analyzer into your PC using one of the supplied cables, preferably the long one.

3. Plug one end of the [USB Adapter Cable for Xbox](https://www.amazon.com/NEORTX-Adapter-Cable-Xbox-Black/dp/B00SMCJB4Y/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1549049686&sr=8-6&keywords=xbox+usb) into the Xbox and the other end into the host port on the analyzer via one of the supplied cables, preferably the short one.

4. Plug the male end of the [USB Splitter Cable Male to 2 Female Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KX4TKH6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) into the device port on the analyzer.

5. Plug the [Type A Male to Male USB Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0E3954/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) into the ``power`` side of the Y adapter (it is marked with a red rubber band).  Then plug the other end of the cable into another USB power source, such as another USB port on your computer or a USB wall plug.  Ideally, this extra power would not be needed, but between the controller's rumble motors and the analyzer too much current is being drawn from the USB port to keep the controller stable.

6. Plug the [Xbox Controller to PC USB Adapter Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Mcbazel-Replacement-Xbox-Controller-Adapter-Microsoft/dp/B000RT2868/ref=sr_1_18?ie=UTF8&qid=1549049720&sr=8-18&keywords=xbox+controller+to+pc) into the ``data`` side of the Y adapter.

7. Plug your Xbox controller into the other end of the [Xbox Controller to PC USB Adapter Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Mcbazel-Replacement-Xbox-Controller-Adapter-Microsoft/dp/B000RT2868/ref=sr_1_18?ie=UTF8&qid=1549049720&sr=8-18&keywords=xbox+controller+to+pc).

8. Run ``RetroSpy.exe``.

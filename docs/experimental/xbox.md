RetroSpy Setup for Original Xbox
======

## Why Experimental?

Xbox is experimental because it currently requires a 400 dollar USB protocol analyzer.  So this solution is only for the most dedicated.  I am also still investigating a high number of controller disconnect events.  I think its due to the ``Xbox Controller to PC USB Adapter Cable``  and not necessarily related to RetroSpy.  They seems to happen more with the original large controller and if you have a memory card inserted into the controller.

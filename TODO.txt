State of Unsupported Controllers


-- Work in Progress --

TurboGraphx

NEO GEO

Gamecube Gameboy Player


-- Probably will work, but haven't attempted --

Atari Driving Controller: Probably possible, but haven't tried. Digital.

Atari 7800: Probably possible, but don't have a 7800. Digital.

Dreamcast: Probably will work, but the protocol is very complicated (i.e. LOTS OF WORK).  Complex serial protocol.

Sega Saturn: Probably possible, but I don't own a Saturn. 4 page banking.

Atari Jaguar: Probably possible, but I don't own a Jaguar.  Much like the atari keyboard controller.  Column by row polling.

Intellivision: Probably possible, but I don't own an Intellivision. Digital.

3DO: Probably possible, but don't own one. 2 page banking.

CD-i: Seems to be a serial communication of some for, so should be possible.  There isn't a lot of documentation online describing the protocol through. http://cdii.blogspot.com/2016/05/now-you-can-play-cd-i-games-with-your.html


-- Currently no plans to support --

Atari Paddles: Must need more electronics because as soon as I plug in the two analog pins to the Arduino the Atari quits responding to the paddle.  I will support these it if I can sort out the problem.

Atari Keyboard Controller: There is no standard read method, so every cartridge does it differently.  This makes it only work on a game by game basis, so really frustrating.

Playstation 2: The protocol is difficult to spy because the console can program the controller to return a custom response format.  This isn't an absolute no, but would require a lot of work.

Original Xbox: The controllers are USB hubs, so without implementing a full USB spy type system its not possible.

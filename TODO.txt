State of Unsupported Controllers


-- Work in Progress --

CD-i: Seems to be a serial communication of some for, so should be possible.  There isn't a lot of documentation online describing the protocol through. http://cdii.blogspot.com/2016/05/now-you-can-play-cd-i-games-with-your.html

Dreamcast: Probably will work, but the protocol is very complicated (i.e. LOTS OF WORK).  Complex serial protocol.  Will need to upgrade the board to a faster board.

-- Probably will work, but haven't attempted --

Atari 7800: Probably possible, but don't have a 7800. Digital.

Atari Jaguar: Probably possible, but I don't own a Jaguar.  Much like the atari keyboard controller.  Column by row polling.

Intellivision: Probably possible, but I don't own an Intellivision. Digital.

-- Currently no plans to support --

Original Xbox: The controllers are USB hubs, so without implementing a full USB spy type system its not possible.

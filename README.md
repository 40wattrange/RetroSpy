It contains the desktop viewer software as well as the Arduino firmware.

This project provides a general solution for live-streaming your controller inputs while speedrunning, or recording inputs for tutorials on how to perform tricks.  It supports tying in to NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and GameCube controller signals to get a live view of them, as well as any gamepad connected to your PC for use with emulators.  XBox 360 is supported out of the box, but other gamepads will require creating a skin.

NintendoSpy supports custom skins using a straight-forward XML-based skin format.  You can also bind controller input combinations to trigger keypresses for hitting checkpoints on your splits.

## Documentation

### Wiring and hardware

The general design of NintendoSpy involves splicing the controller wire, and attaching the appropriate signal wires to an Arduino.  For more in-depth tutorials on how to do this, check out some of the links below.
